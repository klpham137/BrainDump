# CS 4750 Spring App BrainDump
# by Katie Pham

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a journaling app that is meant to be used as a time capsule. For users that often get embarrassed about their past, this app doesn't allow the user to edit or delete entries after the date of it's writing has passed. This means the user can only view their thoughts of the past an keep them forever. Another problem it solves is that hands can get tired from writing for too long especially when there is a lot to say in a journal. This allows users to just type on their phone without ever picking up a pencil or carrying around a physical notebook/journal.
