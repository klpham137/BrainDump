# BrainDump

A final Flutter project for the completion of CS 4750 Spring course

## Description

This project is for people who like to journal, but want to absolutely remember anything. One of the unique features is that the user cannot edit or delete a feature after the day it is written. This allows the app to act like a time capsule of thoughts. Another problem it solve is it is a portable mini journal that doesn't hurt your hand when the user has to write a lot of material for their thoughts.

## Notes

This Flutter application utilizes the google cloud firebase to save the users' journal entries in a unique device. There are also two different views of journal entries for the users to prefer, it starts with a homepage with a calendar, if an entry exists on a date, then the app takes the user to that entry page when clicked. THe other view is in a side drawer where the user may view or delete journal entries by clicking the component.
